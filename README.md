# CMakeIPFSExternalData

[CMake](https://cmake.org) ExternalData module with [InterPlanetary File System](https://ipfs.tech) support.

For more information see the description of the [CMake Web3 ExternalData Upload UI](https://github.com/InsightSoftwareConsortium/cmake-w3-externaldata-upload#about).

This is an extended version of the upstream *ExternalData.cmake* module. This
has not been integrated into upstream CMake due to the availability of C++ CID
verification code to complete the feature set in a portable way.
